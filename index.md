Hi, my name is Nile. I'm a cybersecurity professional working to promote growth, stability and security in Web2/ Web3. I'm focusing on penetration testing, game security and blockchain security, but have also gained a broad range of blue team skills. Below are some samples of my work. Currently I'm focused on penetration test reporting, writing blockchain bug bounty POCs, and a cloud cert. More to come!
