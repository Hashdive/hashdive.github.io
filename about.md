Delivery is a 2d retro blockchain game that I developed in Unity using Nethereum and WalletConnect for Ethereum interaction. Players pay to play, having their funds locked in a smart contract if they lose. If they win, the contract's funds are deposited into the player's wallet minus a rollover percentage. A video demonstration can be found [here](https://youtu.be/oru4SNJuhCo). Excuse my pandemic buzzcut.
